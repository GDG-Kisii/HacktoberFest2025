## About Me
It was so hard starting programming. Going through tutorials, webs, apps books, until I discovered the best thibg to do was to stick with one thing until you fully understood it. After gaining skills Imposter syndrome hitt realy hard until I did my own project seeing the result was the best feeling ever and got me in love. I interacted with some friends and I know for sure everyone has something to contribute.
